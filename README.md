# NetfixClone
#### By: Victor la Cour (Victor la Cour) <victorlacour3@gmail.com> and Morten, and me Emil Ladegaard <emil.ladegaard1@gmail.com>

## Goal
The goal of this project was to use Java to emulate the Graphical User Interface of a streaming service such as Netflix. HBO, etc. 

## Context
This project was made during the 1st semester at the IT University of Copenhagen in cooperation with two fellow students in the course "Grundl√¶ggende Programmering". 

For all members of the group, it was our first official project in which we developed both a back-end and front-end. For the front-end, we used Java-FX to create a frost-panel, hover effect on the movie posters for an immersive user experience. For the back-end, we used a combination of algorithms (KMP) and datastructures (Hash-maps).

## Conclusion
This collaborative project helped spearhead us into becoming proficient object-orientated programmers!
